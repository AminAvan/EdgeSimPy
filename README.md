> A Python-based modeling and simulation framework for Edge Computing resource management policies

EdgeSimPy is a modeling and simulation framework written in Python that facilitates the prototyping of resource management policies in Edge Computing environments. EdgeSimPy features a modular architecture that incorporates several functional abstractions for edge servers, network devices, and applications that allow the modeling of the entire lifecycle of edge applications and ensure seamless integration with real traces. In addition, it implements several built-in models for user mobility, application composition, and power consumption.
